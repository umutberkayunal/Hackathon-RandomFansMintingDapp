# Random Fans NFT Minting dAPP

This is a dApp project for Google Cloud & Bitci hackathon. The goal of this dApp is minting and owning fan NFTs easily. Every NFT is unique and has different species. There are total of 32.768 different possibilities to create a new Random Fan NFT.

## Introduction
As fan bases are stepping up to the blockchain, NFTs have gotten a big share of popularity. We wanted to make an NFT collection and provide users a dApp where they can mint their NFTs easily. Every Random Fans NFT is unique and every part of a single NFT is generated by a rarity algorithm. This means some NFTs are hard to get and this increases the value within the trading.

## Rarity and Randomness

We wanted to implement a rarity system for our collection. For this project, **there are 32.768 different NFTs that can be created with different species**. But we have a maximum supply of 53NFTs in our collection. Parts of the NFTs are eyes, mouths, bodies, jerseys, hats, and backgrounds. Each has their own occurrence chance. For instance, NFTs with hats are more rare because it's occurrence percentage is 3/53. Also, a NFT with McLaren jersey is more rare than the others because user has lower chance to get a McLaren jersey compared to other jerseys. This implementation increase the demand and competitivity which help us to receive higher trading volumes and popularity.

## Interface of dApp
We think the biggest issue in front of NFTs are website interfaces. User must not be distracted with fancy effects and too much texts. Thus, we have kept our interface simple and readable while highlighting the most important functionalities.
